# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

This project predicts the risk of heart attack using machine learning. The model is trained using a **Decision Tree**, achieving **91% accuracy**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses **Decision Tree Classifier** for high accuracy
- Balanced dataset to improve predictions
- Full implementation in **Jupyter Notebook**

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- **Heart_Attack_Prediction.ipynb** â†’ Main notebook with data processing, training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
1. Download the notebook.
2. Open in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4. Run all cells.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Accuracy:** 91%
